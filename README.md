# Web-development-quiz
## Description
This is a short quiz on Web development I built for my bootcamp at UCSD. 
The quiz will give you a 100 seconds to complete it and the time remaining will be your score in the end. If any answer is incorrect it will subtract 10 points from your score.
 The goal on this project was to apply knowledge of creating and removing elements in the DOM using JavaScript. On this project I learned a lot about structuring scripts with a lot more functions built in to them. Got to polish a few more skills on the CSS side of things as well.
## Usage
Upon visiting the page you're greeted with a form to fill out with your initials and then proceed to hit the start quiz button from there. The goal was to eventually push those initials back to you with your score attached to them at the end of the quiz. That was achieved through pushing those to local storage.
All the questions and answers of this quiz are interactive so as soon as you choose an answer you're redirected to the next question and the timer will decrement 10 seconds if you are incorrect.
Upon finishing the quiz it will print out your most recent scores to you, being ordered from most recent attempt to latest attmept.
